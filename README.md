# drb-rb

A collection of dRuby odds and ends. Watch this space.

* `parshal`: A restricted partial implementation of the Ruby Marshal serialization format
* `drb-rb`: An implementation of the dRuby wire protocol in Ruby, but without any of the (dark) magic.

These can be installed using `gem install parshal` and `gem install drb-rb`, respectively.
